## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Typescript
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

This was my first project with NextJs, I'm very happy with the result and excited to learn more about this framework, however as it is the first project I decided to do something a little simpler, so as not to get too stuck in the development of the project, but in soon I will do some more elaborate project.
